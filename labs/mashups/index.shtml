                    </div>

                    <p>In class this week, we learned how to dynamically fetch information from a web server while staying on the same web page (AJAX). Last week, we learned how to embed a live Google Map into our web page, centered on our current coordinates. In this lab, we will combine these two techniques to create a live map that plots sample earthquake data provided by the US Geological Survey, which we will fetch using AJAX.</p>

                <section id="code">
                    <h2>Write the JavaScript</h2>

                    <p>Before we get to writing code, let's look at the page we will be building today:</p>

                    <p><img class="screen-shot img-responsive" src="img/quake-map.png" alt="screen shot of quake map page"></p>

                    <p>This page uses AJAX to get the set of recent earthquakes, and the Google Maps API to plot them on an interactive map. The earthquake data is provided by the USGS, though I should admit that this is not actually <em>live</em> data&mdash;instead, this is sample data returned by the <a href="http://dev.socrata.com/consumers/getting-started">Socrata Open Data API (SODA)</a>, which they use as demo data for their service. SODA provides programmatic access to lots of open public datasets, so the techniques you learn in this lab should enable you to do something similar with <a href="https://data.seattle.gov/">other datasets they offer</a>.</p>

                    <p>In addition to plotting the quakes on the Google Map, we will also write the code to show an information window with details about the quake when the user clicks on the marker. This will look like so:</p>

                    <p><img class="screen-shot img-responsive" src="img/quake-info.png" alt="screen shot of quake info window"></p>

                    <p class="alert alert-info">As per usual, there are some optional steps for this lab, one of which involves adding a minimum magnitude filter and refresh button. See the <a href="#optional-steps">optional steps</a> for more details.</p>

                    <p>Let's build this page, step-by-step.</p>

                    <h3>Review the HTML File</h3>

                    <p>Before we start writing JavaScript, let's take a quick look at the 'index.html' file in the project's root folder. I've provided the markup for you, as there's not all that much that needs to be included. The visible content in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section is this:</p>

                    <pre><code>
&lt;h1&gt;Earthquakes Recorded Over the Last 7 Days&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;data-description&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;map-container&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>There is an empty paragraph with the class 'data-description', and this will be used to show some information to the reader after we've plotted the quakes on the map.</p>

                    <p>The empty <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is where we will put the Google map, and we've given it a class name of 'map-container'. There is a style rule for this class defined in <code>css/styles.css</code>, which sets the width to 100% and the height to 600px.</p>

                    <p>There are also a few <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements, the first of which is for the Google Maps library:</p>

                    <pre><code>
&lt;!-- Google Maps API library --&gt;
&lt;!-- NOTE: the vale in the &#039;key&#039; query string parameter is my API key
        you should register for your own key and replace this value
        go to https://code.google.com/apis/console
--&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyAqnfFcZYL5k3Tav9kCUmZOSC-42yJupmc&amp;amp;sensor=false&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>As I noted in the comments, the key query string parameter value is my Google API Key. If you've <a href="https://code.google.com/apis/console">created your own Google API key</a>, you might want to replace the key currently in this url with yours. Google limits the number of map requests to 25,000 per key per day, so using your own key will enable you to have many more requests per day than using my shared key.</p>

                    <h3>Preview the Data Returned From the Server</h3>

                    <p>You will be requesting data from the following URL: <a href="https://soda.demo.socrata.com/resource/earthquakes.json?$$app_token=Hwu90cjqyFghuAWQgannew7Oi" target="_blank">https://soda.demo.socrata.com/resource/earthquakes.json?$$app_token=Hwu90cjqyFghuAWQgannew7Oi</a>. Click on that link now to see what kind of data is returned (this should open a new browser tab).</p>

                    <p>Note that the returned data is an array of objects, where each object contains information about a particular earthquake. Each earthquake object has a property called <code>location</code>, which contains another object with the properties <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code>. That will give us the latitude and longitude of the quake. There are also a few other properties that we will use in an information window: <code>datetime</code> (date and time of the quake); <code>magnitude</code>; and <code>depth</code>.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Write a Document Ready Function</h3>

                    <p>As with all scripted web pages, we first need to register a function that should be called when the document in ready for manipulation. The <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/">jQuery library makes this quite easy</a>, but if you've forgotten the syntax, it looks like this:</p>

                    <pre><code>
//function to call when document is ready
$(function(){
    //document is ready for manipulation
    
}); //doc ready
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>Inside this function, you should call a function that you will write in the next step: <code>getQuakes()</code>.</p>

                    <h3>Write a Function to Get the Earthquake Data</h3>

                    <p>Create a new function in your JavaScript file called <code>getQuakes()</code> that takes no parameters (in an optional step, we'll add one but for now, keep the parameter list empty). The syntax for this would look like:</p>

                    <pre><code>
//getQuakes()
//queries the server for the list of recent quakes
//and plots them on a Google map
function getQuakes() {


} //getQuakes()
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>Inside the function, you should use jQuery's <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/">getJSON()</a> method to request the URL stored in the global variable <code>gov.usgs.quakesUrl</code> (defined at the top of this file). This method takes two parameters: the URL to request; and a function to call with the parsed results. That callback function will be passed a few parameters, but the first one is the only one we need to care about: a referenced to the parsed JSON data, which in our case will be an array of objects, each of which represents an earthquake.</p>

                    <p>The syntax for requesting the URL, and supplying a function to call with the results, looks like this:</p>

                    <pre><code>
$.getJSON(gov.usgs.quakesUrl, function(quakes){
    //quakes is an array of objects, each of which represents info about a quake
    //see data returned from:
    //https://soda.demo.socrata.com/resource/earthquakes.json?$$app_token=Hwu90cjqyFghuAWQgannew7Oi

    //set our global variable to the current set of quakes
    //so we can reference it later in another event
    gov.usgs.quakes = quakes;

}); //handle returned data function
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>Note how we are caching the quakes array in our global variable <code>gov.usgs.quakes</code>. This will allow us to reference the quakes array later in another event, which we will do if you choose to do the optional steps.</p>

                    <p>After setting the global variable, the next thing we want to do is update the HTML of our <code>&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;</code> element to let the user know how many quakes were returned. Use jQuery to select that element by its class name, and update its HTML to the expression <code>'Displaying ' + quakes.length + ' earthquakes'</code>.</p>

                    <p>Inside this callback function that receives the data, we want to create a new <code><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference">google.maps.Map</a></code> object and then add markers for each quake in our dataset. We've already written <a href="https://github.com/drstearns/in-class-code-a/blob/master/geoloc/js/geo-demo.js">the code to create a Google Map based on or current location</a>, so we'll use that as a starting point. Instead of a road map, we'll use <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#MapTypeId">a terrain map</a>. And instead of centering the map on our current coordinates, we'll center it on Lat/Long 0/0, as this is world-wide data. Finally, we'll disable the Street View control, as that wouldn't make much sense for this application.</p>

                    <p>The code to create the map would look like this:</p>

                    <pre><code>
gov.usgs.quakesMap = new google.maps.Map($(&#039;.map-container&#039;)[0], {
    center: new google.maps.LatLng(0,0),        //centered on 0/0
    zoom: 2,                                    //zoom level 2
    mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.TERRAIN,   //terrain map
    streetViewControl: false                    //no street view
});
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>Note that we are assigning the new map object to our global variable gov.usgs.quakesMap, and we are passing the map options as an inline object.</p>

                    <p>After creating the map, your next line of code should call the function we will write in the next step: <code>addQuakeMarkers(quakes, map)</code>, passing the quakes array as the first parameter, and the map we just created as the second.</p>

                    <h3>Write a Function to Build the Map and Add the Markers</h3>

                    <p>Add a new function to your JavaScript file called <code>addQuakeMarkers(quakes, map)</code></p>

                    <pre><code>
//addQuakeMarkers()
//parameters
// - quakes (array) array of quake data objects
// - map (google.maps.Map) Google map we can add markers to
// no return value
function addQuakeMarkers(quakes, map) {
    
    //loop over the quakes array and add a marker for each quake
    var quake;      //current quake data
    var idx;        //loop counter

    for (idx = 0; idx &lt; quakes.length; ++idx) {
        quake = quakes[idx];

        //latitude of current quake = quake.location.latitude 
        //longitutde of current quake = quake.location.longitude

    }

    
} //addQuakeMarkers()
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>Inside this function, you should loop over the quakes array and create a new <code><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Marker">google.maps.Marker</a></code> for each quake in the array.</p>

                    <p class="alert alert-warning">Note that some quake objects might not have a <code>location</code> property containing the exact latitude and longitude of the quake, so you should test if this property is present before creating the Marker using code like <code>if (quake.location) { ... }</code>.</p>

                    <p>When creating the new <code>google.maps.Marker</code> object, you need to provide a simple JavaScript object for the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#MarkerOptions">marker options</a>, and that object should contain the following properties: map and position. The map property should contain a reference to our <code>google.maps.Map</code> object, and the position property should contain a new <code>google.maps.LatLng</code> object, initialized to the quake's <code>location.latitude</code> and <code>location.longitude</code> properties. The syntax would look like this:</p>

                    <pre><code>
//assuming that the variable 'quake' is set to 
//the current quake object within the quakes array...
quake.mapMarker = new google.maps.Marker({
    map: map,
    position: new google.maps.LatLng(quake.location.latitude, quake.location.longitude)
});
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>Note that we are assigning this new <code>google.maps.Marker</code> object to a new property on the quake object called <code>mapMarker</code>. This will allow us to remove the marker later if you choose to do the optional steps.</p>

                    <p>At this point, if you've coded everything correctly, you should be able to open the index.html file in your browser, and see the various quakes plotted on the map using markers. If you don't see the markers, open your Developer Tools (or Firebug on Firefox) and look in the Console tab for error messages.</p>

                    <h3>Add Code to Show the Info Windows</h3>

                    <p>Now that you have the markers showing the locations of all the quakes, our final step is to show a <code><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#InfoWindow">google.maps.InfoWindow</a></code> with detailed information about the quake when the user clicks on a given marker.</p>

                    <p>If you added an InfoWindow during our in-class challenge, this will be somewhat familiar for you. To show an InfoWindow, you need to use the Google map API to register a click event handler function for each marker you create. Since the <code>google.maps.Marker</code> class is specific to the Google Maps API, you need to use their event registration function, which looks like this:</p>

                    <pre><code>
google.maps.event.addListener(quake.mapMarker, 'click', function(){
    //code that runs when user clicks on a marker

}); //click handler for marker
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>These lines of code to should be right after you create each new marker. Note that the marker passed to the first parameter of the <code>addListener()</code> method is the variable <code>quake.mapMarker</code>, which we assigned when we created the marker for a given quake object. The second parameter is the name of the event ('click' in this case), and the third parameter is a function to call when the user clicks on the marker.</p>

                    <p>Inside this function, you should create a new <code><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#InfoWindow">google.maps.InfoWindow</a></code> object. This object's constructor accepts a simple options object, and we need to specify only one property: <code>content</code>. The content property should be set to a string listing information about the quake: when it occurred, its magnitude, and its depth. You can use a string expression such as:</p>

                    <pre><code>
//create an info window with the quake info
gov.usgs.iw = new google.maps.InfoWindow({
    content: new Date(quake.datetime).toLocaleString() + 
        &#039;: magnitude &#039; + quake.magnitude + &#039; at depth of &#039; + 
        quake.depth + &#039; meters&#039;
});

//open the info window
gov.usgs.iw.open(map, this);
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>If you've coded everything correctly, you should now be able to refresh your page, click on a marker, and see the info window appear with additional information about the quake.</p>

                    <p class="alert alert-info">Note that we haven't yet added the code to automatically close the previous InfoWindow before showing the next one, so when you click each marker, it will open a new InfoWindow that you have to close manually. To close the previous one automatically, see <a href="#hide-prev-iw">the optional steps</a>.</p>

                <section id="optional-steps">
                    <h2>Optional Steps</h2>

                    <p>If you get done early, or just want the extra challenge, try some of these optional steps.</p>

                    <h3 id="hide-prev-iw">Hide Previous Info Window Before Showing Next</h3>

                    <p>In the required steps we added an info window that is shown when the user clicks a marker, but the user also had to manually close that window. In this optional step, we will close the previous info window before showing the next.</p>

                    <p>To accomplish this, you need to assign the <code>google.maps.InfoWindow</code> object you create during the click event function to a global variable so that the next time that event fires, you can test whether that global variable has a value and if so, call the <code>close()</code> method to close the previous window.</p>

                    <p>If you used my sample code above, you are already assigning a reference to the InfoWindow to a global variable called <code>gov.usgs.iw</code>. If you didn't use that code, assign the new <code>google.maps.InfoWindow</code> object to some global variable that you can reference the next time the click event handler function is called.</p>

                    <p>Next, add two lines of code to the beginning of the click event handler function in which you create the InfoWindow. The first line should test whether your global variable has a value (<code>if (gov.usgs.iw) { ... }</code>). The second line should go inside the <code>if</code> block, and use your global variable to call the <code>close()</code> method of the previous InfoWindow. Remember that your global variable is holding a reference to the previous InfoWindow you created, so you'd call this method on your global variable.</p>

                    <h3>Add Visual Feedback During AJAX Request</h3>

                    <p>When making an AJAX request to the server for data, it's often good to show the user some visual feedback in case that request ends up taking a while due to network traffic or a slow server. In this optional step, we'll add a loading message to our <code>&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;</code> element so that the user knows we are actively loading data. If the request completes quickly, the user will likely never see this message, but if it happens to take a while, the message will let the user know something is actually happening.</p>

                    <p>Loading messages usually involve a bit of text (e.g., 'Loading...'), as well as an animated icon. I've included a suitable icon in your 'img' directory named 'loading.gif'.</p>

                    <p>The easiest way to add both is to just update the HTML of the <code>&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;</code> element to include both the text and an <code>&lt;img src="img/loading.gif&gt;</code> element. The jQuery <code>html()</code> method accepts a string that can contain HTML tags as well as plain text. For example:</p>

                    <pre><code>
$(&#039;.message&#039;).html(&#039;Loading... &lt;img src=&quot;img/loading.gif&quot;&gt;&#039;);
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>This message will get replaced once the data returns, as you've already written the code to update the <code>&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;</code> element with the number of quakes being displayed.</p>

                    <p>Adding HTML markup via strings will work, but it's also a bit error-prone&mdash;it's easy to omit an important character and then your page will suddenly render incorrectly. A safer and more elegant way to do this would be to add a style class to the element (e.g., 'loading') and create a CSS rule using the selector <code>.loading:after { ... }</code>. The <code><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_after.asp">:after</a></code> pseudo-selector allows you to add new text content to an element via the <code>content</code> CSS property, and you can also specify a <code>background-image</code> property for the loading.gif image. If you want the extra-extra challenge, try adding the loading message using this technique.</p>

                    <p>Note that if the data returns quickly, you won't be able to see this message, as the browser will never get a chance to actually display it on screen. To test that this is working correctly, use the Developer Tools (or Firebug on Firefox) to set a breakpoint on the line of code where you assign the returned <code>quakes</code> array to the global variable. This pauses your script, and you should be able to see your loading message.</p>

                    <h3 id="min-mag-filter">Add a Minimum Magnitude Filter</h3>

                    <p>So far, our page only does one request for data on load, and never updates that data. In this step, we'll add some user interface elements that will let the user specify a minimum magnitude filter, as well as the code to refresh the dataset and map with that filter applied.</p>

                    <p>First, let's add the filtering UI to our index.html page. Add this markup just after the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and before the <code>&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;</code></p>

                    <pre><code>
&lt;p class=&quot;filters&quot;&gt;Minimum Magnitude: 
    &lt;input type=&quot;number&quot; class=&quot;min-magnitude&quot; value=&quot;0&quot; min=&quot;0&quot; max=&quot;10&quot; step=&quot;0.1&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;button class=&quot;refresh-button&quot;&gt;Refresh&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>Here we are using an <code>&lt;input type=&quot;number&quot;&gt;</code> to let the user specify a minimum magnitude, and a refresh button the user can click to refresh the data and map.</p>
                    
                    <p>Return to the earthquakes.js file and add a click event handler for the refresh button inside your document ready function. Inside your click event handler function, use jQuery to get a reference to the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element by its class name (min-magnitude) and use the <code>val()</code> function to get its current value. Then call your <code>getQuakes()</code> function, passing the current input value as a parameter.</p>

                    <p>Next, add a parameter to your <code>getQuakes()</code> function called <code>minMagnitude</code>. This will be an optional parameter, so we will test whether the caller passed a value, and if so, we will append a filter expression to the URL we request. Add this code to the start of your <code>getQuakes()</code> function:</p>

                    <pre><code>
function getQuakes(minMagnitude) {
    //if minMagnitude was specified, add that as a filter
    var url = gov.usgs.quakesUrl;
    if (minMagnitude)
        url += &#039;&amp;$where=magnitude&gt;=&#039; + minMagnitude;

    //...rest of your existing code...

} //getQuakes()
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>This code starts with the same URL we've been using (<code>gov.usgs.quakesUrl</code>), but appends an extra query string parameter if <code>minMagnitude</code> was supplied. The query string filter syntax is defined by the Socrata web site, and they use a parameter named <code>$where</code> set to a SQL where clause expression.</p>

                    <p>Next, change your <code>$.getJSON()</code> call so that it uses this new variable <code>url</code> instead of the global <code>gov.usgs.quakesUrl</code> variable.</p>

                    <p>All of this will get us new data, filtered by a minimum magnitude, but to complete this feature, we also need to remove the existing map markers before we add new ones for the updated dataset. Sadly, the Google Map object doesn't have a single method to do this (like <code>clearMarkers()</code> or <code>reset()</code>). Instead, we need to call the <code>setMap()</code> method on each of our existing markers, passing null for the map. This will cause the marker to be removed from our map.</p>

                    <p>While creating the markers, I had you assign each new marker to a new property of the quake data object that we called <code>mapMarker</code>. Since we have a global variable that references the current dataset, we can simply loop over that dataset, and use the <code>mapMarker</code> property on each quake to call the associated marker's <code>setMap()</code> method passing null as the first and only parameter. Add that code to your AJAX callback function, just before you set the global <code>gov.usgs.quakes</code> variable to the new dataset returned by the server.</p>

                    <p>Lastly, you need to add a quick <code>if()</code> test around the code that creates your Google Map. If we are just refreshing the data with a filter applied, we don't need to create a new Map object. Since we are setting the global variable <code>gov.usgs.quakesMap</code> to be a reference to our existing map, check this variable before you create the Map, and only create the Map if that variable is undefined. Remember that in JavaScript, undefined will evaluate to false in an if() check.</p>
