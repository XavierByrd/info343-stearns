        <h1>INFO 343 Lab 1: Managing Your Files</h1>

        <p>Welcome to your first lab for INFO 343! Since we've only had one brief class so far, we will use this lab to practice using a few file management tools that nearly every web development project requires:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>a good text editor optimized for web development</li>
          <li>a collaborative version control system (VCS) for managing files and versions</li>
          <li>a graphical FTP tool for moving files up to a web server</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>In other words, we won't worry all that much today on what is <em>inside</em> our web project files; rather we will learn how to effectively manage those files, as most projects will generate <em>a lot</em> of them. We will utilize these tools throughout the course, and most any web development job will require that you know how to use them well.</p>
        
        <p>If you finish all the required steps before the end of the hour, go on to the <a href="#steps-optional">optional steps</a> and see if you can do them....go ahead...I dare you.</p>
      
        <h2>General Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>If you get stuck, feel free to search the web, talk with your friends, or ask the TA for help. But do try to work out the solution yourself, and don't just copy the work of others without understanding it. You won't learn anything if you do that.</li>
          <li>At the end of the lab, submit your files and URLs via Canvas (the TA will show you how to do this before you begin).</li>
          <li>If you don't finish all the required tasks, turn in whatever you have done at the end of the lab; you can then submit a completed version of your files within 72 hours without penalty.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="step-repository">Create a GitHub Repository</h3>
        
        <p>Many students think that version control systems (VCS) aren't necessary until you are working in a large team, but professional developers know different: a good VCS can help you manage your files, track changes, try new ideas without jeopardizing your working code, and easily rollback to a previous version when you mess up something. Even projects that start out small tend to grow into large, collaborative ones, so it's always a good idea to use a VCS for every project you do.</p>

        <p>In this class we will use one of the most popular VCSs: <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and the related public repository, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. Git is the command-line engine that does most of the work, and GitHub provides a space on the Web where developers can collaborate on projects.</p>

        <p>Git is a command-line utility, but there are many graphical tools available that make it easier to use. Today we will use a popular one that is free and available on multiple platforms: <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a>. It is a powerful graphical tool that exposes nearly all the underlying Git functionality. It's user interface is a bit cluttered and overwhelming at first, but follow the instructions carefully and you will get the hang of it quickly.</p>

        <p class="alert alert-warning">If you haven't already created a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub account</a>, do so now by going to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and completing the registration.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Got to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and sign in to your account.</li>
          <li>Create a new public repository named 'info343-lab1' and initialize it with a README file so you can start working with it right away.</li>
          <li>...is SourceTree on lab machines?...TODO</li>
        </ul>


        <h3 id="step-page">Write a Basic Web Page</h3>
        
        <p>Now that your repository is ready, you will next create a basic profile page for your favorite fictional character and add it to the repository directory. This can be any character from a book, story, film, TV show, movie, comic book, online video, etc. Since we've covered HTML only briefly so far, I have provided you a basic HTML template file to start with, and you will add only a bit of basic content. Follow these steps:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Download the <a href="template.html">basic HTML page template</a> to the local repository directory you created in the first step.</li>
          <li>Rename the file you just downloaded to 'index.html'. Most web servers will look for a file named index.html and return it if the browser only requests the directory in which the file exists.</li>
          <li>Open index.html in your preferred text editor. If you don't have a preferred editor, try <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> if it is installed on your lab machine. This is a very powerful editor optimized for web development, and is currently quite popular amongst professional web developers.</li>
          <li>Find the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section, and replace its content with the name of your character.</li>
          <li>Now add some textural content within the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag:
            <ol>
              <li>Add the character's name as a top-level heading.</li>
              <li>Add a paragraph that describes the character in general terms.</li>
              <li>Add another paragraph naming the source of the character (the name of the book/story/movie/show/etc in which that character appeared), and make that name be a hyperlink to an authoritative page on that source (e.g., a Wikipedia page, a movie/show homepage, etc.)</li>
              <li>Find a picture of that character and download it to a sub-folder under your web page named 'img'. Then add that picture to the end of your page. If the picture is particularly large, add a <code>width</code> or <code>height</code> attribute to make it more appropriately-sized.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Save the page, and open it in a web browser to view it. You can simply double-click the file in the file explorer, and the operating system will open it in the default browser. To open it in another browser (e.g., Firefox or Chrome), launch that browser, choose File &rarr; Open..., and select your file.</li>
          <li>If everything looks OK, move on to the next step. If something doesn't look right, return to your text editor and figure out what's wrong. Ask your friends or the TA for help if you get stuck.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="step-validate">Validate Your Page</h3>

        <p>Older versions of HTML were rather loose and ill-defined, so browsers became quite forgiving of badly-written HTML. This is still mostly true today, so just because your page seems to "work" in a browser doesn't mean that it's properly-formed. Thankfully, there are some quick and easy tools you can use to validate your pages. We will use one of those to validate the page you just created:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Open the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Validator Tool</a> in a web browser.</li>
          <li>Click on the "Validate by File Upload" tab. Note that you can also validate by direct input (which means copying/pasting your content into a text box instead of uploading a file), or by giving it a URL to an existing page on the web.</li>
          <li>In the "File:" input box, click the "Choose File" button and select your "index.html" file created in the previous section.</li>
          <li>Click the "Check" button, and view the results.</li>
          <li>If you see a red banner across the top saying you had errors, scroll down to see the details. Correct those errors and keep validating until it passes.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="step-scc">Manage Your Files in Version Control System</h3>

        <p>Your index.html and image files are in the repository directory, but they haven't yet been 'committed' to the repository. Committing files means that you think they are ready to go, or at least are in a done-enough state that others can start looking at them. Let's now commit your files and see how Git can help you manage changes to those files over time.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Return to the SourceTree application.</li>
          <li>...TODO...</li>
          <li>Now commit these changes to your repository. Every commit must have a short message describing what is included in the commit, or why you are making the change. These messages help other developers in the same project know what you did and why you did it. Enter a suitable message and click the 'Commit' button.</li>
          <li>At this point, you've committed your changes to your local repository, but you haven't yet pushed those changes up to the GitHub server so that others can see them. To do that, click the .... </li>
          <li>To verify that your files got to the server, return to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, select your repository, and make sure you two files are there. You can also click on the files to see their contents.</li>
          <li>Now let's make a change to your HTML file, commit, and publish that change:
            <ol>
              <li>Open index.html in your editor again, add a hyperlink to your GitHub repository page, and save the file.</li>
              <li>View the file in your web browser to verify that the new link is there and displayed correctly.</li>
              <li>Now return to the SourceTree app ... TODO ...</li>
              <li>Enter a commit message, and commit your change.</li>
              <li>Click the 'Push' button to push your commit up to GitHub.</li>
              <li>View your repository on the GitHub web site, click on index.html, and verify that your change is in the file.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Lastly, let's make a horrible mistake in your file, and see how Git makes it easy to discard that change, rolling back to your last good commit:
            <ol>
              <li>Open index.html in your editor, and mangle it. Delete a bunch of text, remove a required end tag, and maybe add an obscenity or two. Save the file and view it in your browser to verify that your changes have messed things up.</li>
              <li>At this point you could try to reverse all your edits, but it's much easier to let Git do that for you. Git knows exactly what you've changed since your last commit, and can easily rollback your files to that earlier state.</li>
              <li>Return to the SourceTree app ... TODO ...</li>
              <li>Now re-open your index.html page in your editor and web browser and notice that the page is back to where it was after your last commit. Hooray!</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Git can do quite a lot more than what we've practiced here. You can create new branches to try out ideas while still being able to switch back to the master code to make a quick fix. GitHub also offers quite a lot of basic project services, from wikis to issue tracking. To learn more about what Git can do, including how to use it from the command line, see the free book <a href="http://git-scm.com/book">Pro Git</a>. For more information on how to use GitHub, see the <a href="https://help.github.com/">GitHub Help site</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="step-ftp">Upload your Files to a Web Server via FTP</h3>

        <p>Now that you have created your page and managed your files in a version control system, you now need to push them to your target web server. Many teams use their version control system to do this (see <a href="#steps-optional">optional steps</a> below), but the way we will practice today is uploading them via FTP. We will use a graphical FTP tool, but note that you can also use FTP from the command line, which is useful when writing automated scripts.</p>

        <p>There are many graphical FTP tools to choose from, but the one we will use today is the one already installed on your lab machines: FileZilla.</p>

        <p class="alert alert-warning">If you haven't already signed up for a free iSchool student web hosting account, do so now by going to the <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/technology/web-hosting/manage">iSchool student web hosting management page</a>, and following the signup instructions. Note that you will need access to your UW email to complete the process, and you should <strong>use a different password than you use for your UW NetID</strong>.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the FileZilla application.</li>
          <li>Create a new site in the Site Manager so that you can easily connect to this site in the future:
            <ol>
              <li>Choose File &rarr; Site Manager... to open up the Site Manager dialog.</li>
              <li>Click the New Site button on the lower-left to create a new site.</li>
              <li>Type a unique name for your new site. Something like 'iSchool Student Web Hosting' might be a good idea.</li>
              <li>In the 'Host:' field, enter 'webhost.ischool.uw.edu'. This is the address of the web server.</li>
              <li>In the 'Port:' field, enter 7822. This is the port number to use for SFTP on our student web hosting servers (normally you would use port 22, but the provider has configured things differently).</li>
              <li>In the 'Protocol:' drop-down, select 'SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol'. This is a more secure protocol than standard FTP and should be used if possible.</li>
              <li>In the 'Logon Type:' drop-down, choose 'Ask for password'. This will cause FileZilla to always prompt you for your password instead of storing it.</li>
              <li>In the 'User:' field, enter your UW NetID.</li>
              <li>Click the 'Connect' button and supply your password when prompted (this is the password you used when signing up for the account, not your UW Net ID password). If all goes well, you should see a bunch of messages in the top pane, and a list of files in the right two panes.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>The files listed on the left are on your local computer, and the files listed on the right are on the server. Our tasks is to copy the files we created during this lab to the web publishing folder (/public_html) on the server.
            <ol>
              <li>Select the '/public_html' folder on the server.</li>
              <li>Create a new sub-folder under /public_html called 'info343-lab1'.</li>
              <li>Find your local repository folder in in the local computer file listing on the left.</li>
              <li>Select index.html, the 'img' folder, and your image file, and drag them over to the newly-created info343-lab1 directory on the server.</li>
              <li>You should see messages that your files were copied, and you should see them in the right-side file listing.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To verify that the files got to the server, open a web browser and enter the following URL into the address field, replacing <em>your-netid</em> with your UW NetID: <code>http://webhost.ischool.uw.edu/~<em>your-netid</em>/info343lab1/</code>. If you've done everything correctly, you should see your web page, including the image you added to the page.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="step-submit">Submit Your Site URL via Canvas</h3>

        <p>When you are finished, go to the <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses">Canvas</a> site for this class, click on the Lab 1 assignment link, and submit the URL to your published web site.</p>

        <p>If you have extra time, consider doing one or more of the <a href="#steps-optional">Optional Steps</a> listed below</p>

        <h2 id="steps-optional">Optional Steps</h2>

        <p>If you've finished early, go on to try some of these more advanced, optional steps.</p>

        <h3>Branching and Merging</h3>

        <p>One of Git's more powerful features is branching. So far, you've been working on what is known as the 'master' branch in repository, but you can actually create many other branches from this master one, and merge changes between them.</p>

        <p>Branching is useful when you are working on a new feature that might take some time to compete, but you also need to periodically do something on the master branch (quick bug fix, testing, etc). As you switch back and forth between your branches, Git updates your local files accordingly.</p>

        <p>Let's practice creating a branch, making some changes, and merging those changes back into the master branch:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Return to the SourceTree application.</li>
          <li>...TODO...</li>
          <li>Return to your text editor and make some changes to your index.html file. You might want to do the changes suggested in the <a href="#step-more-content">Adding More Content to Your Page</a> step below.</li>
          <li>When you're finished with your changes, close your text editor and return to the SourceTree application.</li>
          <li>...TODO...</li>

        </ol>

        <h3 id="step-more-content">Adding More Content to Your Page</h3>
        <p>If you already know a bit of HTML, or if you just happen to be quick and want the challenge of adding more content to your page, try adding one or more of the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp">list</a> of adjectives that describe your character.</li>
          <li>Emphasize a word or two in your text using the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag.</li>
          <li>Make a few of your words strong using the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag.</li>
          <li>Add a copyright notice using the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp">HTML character entity</a> for the copyright symbol (&copy;).</li>
          <li>Add a comment to your page source using the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_comment.asp">comment tag</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Using Git and SSH to Synchronize the Web Server (Double Black Diamond)</h3>

        <p class="alert alert-danger">If you are comfortable using the command line, you can try this step. Be careful though! Like Spiderman reminds us, with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

        <p>If your web server allows you SFTP access, it probably also allows you secure shell (SSH) access. SSH allows you to work at the command line on the web server itself, which opens up a number of interesting possibilities. One of those is the ability to update your web server by pulling the most recent files directly from your GitHub repository. You can use one quick command to update all the files on your web server to their most recent versions.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Got to your repository on the <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub web site</a>. On your repository home page, there should be a box on the right entitled 'HTTPS clone URL'. Click the copy to clipboard button, or select the URL and copy it to your clipboard. You'll need this later so you might want to paste it into a new text editor window.</li>

          <li>At the command line, SSH to the web server by entering the command <code>ssh <em>your-netid</em>@webhost.ischool.uw.edu -p7822</code>, replacing <code><em>your-netid</em></code> with your UW Net ID. The -p7822 part tells SSH to use port 7822 instead of the default port 22, which is what the iSchool student web hosts listen on.</li>

          <li>Enter your password at the prompt. This is your iSchool Student Web Hosting password, not your UW NetID password.</li>
          <li>Once connected, change to the public_html/ directory (<code>cd public_html/</code>).</li>
          <li>Now use git to clone your repository into a new sub-directory of public_html. To do that, Execute this command: <code>git clone <em>your-clone-url</em> info343-lab1-git</code>, replacing <em>your-clone-url</em> with the URL you copied on the GitHub site. By default, git clone will create a directory with the same name as your GitHub repository, but since we've already created a directory with that name when FTPing the files, we use that last parameter to tell git to use a different directory name. In this case 'info343-lab1-git'.</li>
          <li>You should see a number of messages fly by, with the final one being 'Resolving deltas: 100% ... done.'</li>
          <li>To make sure everything worked, view your page in the browser by going to the following URL (where your-netid is replaced with your UW NetID): <code>http://webhost.ischool.uw.edu/~<em>your-netid</em>/info343-lab1-git/</code></li>
        </ol>

        <p>Your repository is now cloned to the web server. After you make, commit, and push any changes to GitHub, you can then SSH over to the web server and run the command <code>git pull</code> from within the project directory. Any changes you've made since the last pull will be applied to the files, and your web site will be up to date!</p>
