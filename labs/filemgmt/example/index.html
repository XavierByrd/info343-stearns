		<p>Dave Lister is the last human being still alive. That's too bad, as he's also a completely lazy, immature, unwashed space bum. Lister was put into statis because he was unwilling to give up a stray cat he brought on board the space mining ship known as Red Dwarf. A radiation leak killed the rest of the crew, and the computer (known as Holly) took the ship out into deep space. Holly released Lister from stasis after the radiation levels dropped to a safe level, which took three million years. Holly, Lister, a hologram of Lister's dead bunkmate Rimmer, and a creature that evolved from Lister's cat now crew Red Dwarf as they attempt to make their way back to Earth.</p>

		<p>This character comes from the hit British TV series <a href="http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/">Red Dwarf</a>.</p>
