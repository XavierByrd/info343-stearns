            <h1>Lab 2: Building a Basic Web Site</h1>
            <p class="lead">HTML, CSS, and Server-Side Includes</p>
        </div>

        <p>In our previous lab, we practiced using various tools and techniques to manage our files, but we didn't worry all that much about what was <em>inside</em> those files. In this lab, you will practice the following skills, which we learned this week:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Writing a well-formed, semantically-correct series of related HTML files</li>
            <li>Segmenting content that is common to all pages into server-side includes</li>
            <li>Styling your HTML with basic CSS</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>General Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If you get stuck at any point, search the Internet, ask your neighbor, or ask the TA for help.</li>
            <li>At the end of the lab, submit your published site URL via the <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses">Canvas assignment</a> for this lab.</li>
            <li>If you don't finish all the required tasks during our lab time, finish them over the weekend and submit your published site URL before 8:00am on Monday morning.</li>
            <li>If you finish all the required steps, go on and try some of the optional ones.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Required Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Build your html pages, utilizing server-side includes where appropriate</li>
            <li>Style your pages to look like the target screen shot</li>
            <li>Publish your site to your student web hosting server and submit the site URL via Canvas</li>
        </ol>
