                    <p>In the late 1980s, Tim Berners-Lee was working at CERN and looking for a way to keep track of all the people there, what projects they were working on, and how they all related.</p>
                    <p class="fragment">Hypertext seemed like a great idea, but existing tools were too static and centralized.</p>
                    <p class="fragment">What if pages were simple text files on on multiple hosts, with an easy way to link between them?</p>

Suppose I could program my computer to create a space in which everything could be linked to anything. All the bits of information in every computer at CERN, and on the planet, would be available to me and to anyone else. There would be a single global information space."</blockquote>

                <section>
                    <p>First web browser was an augmented version of the NeXT word processor; browsing and editing in the same tool.</p>
                    <p class="fragment">Simple markup language (HTML) was intended to encode <em>meaning</em> into otherwise plain text.</p>
                    <p class="fragment">Multipe types of "agents" could display HTML in context-appropriate ways (graphical, console text, print).</p>
                    <p class="fragment">Semantics &ne; Presentation</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <p>But as the web caught on, people started using HTML elements to achieve particular visual effects, even if the semantics were all wrong.</p>
                    <p class="fragment">Presentaiton-oriented tags were added (<code>&lt;b&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;font&gt;</code>).</p>
                    <p class="fragment">Semantics and presentation started to meld...</p>
                    <p class="fragment">...and HTML descended into <strong>CHAOS</strong>...</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <p>CSS came along in the late-1990s to re-separate semantics and presentation (hooray!).</p>
                    <p class="fragment">Meanwhile, the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) was gaining popularity, and some thought it was a better solution for semantic markup than HTML.</p>
                    <p class="fragment">Thus was born the beast...<strong>XHTML</strong>...</p>
                    <p class="fragment">...great idea, but too many arbitrary rules....</p>
                </section>

                    <p>HTML</p>
                    <pre><code data-trim>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt; ... &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;case-insensitive, end tags sometimes optional,
        marker attrs OK
        &lt;img src=&quot;mycat.jpg&quot;&gt;
        &lt;button disabled&gt;Click Me!&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
                    </code></pre>
                    
                    <p>XHTML</p>
                    <pre><code data-trim>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot;

&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
    &lt;head&gt; ... &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;case-sensitive, end tags or self-close required,
        attrs must have a value&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;mycat.jpg&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;button disabled=&quot;disabled&quot;&gt;Click Me!&lt;/button&gt;

                <section>
                    <p>XHTML never really caught on, mostly because it was such a pain to write!</p>
                    <p class="fragment">An alternative plan was hatched by a group of renegades, which soon became known as "HTML 5."</p>
                    <p class="fragment">Intent was to clean up HTML, keep it simple, and return to a focus on semantics.</p>
