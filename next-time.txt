Notes for Next Time
------------------------

First Day:
- On the first day, do overview of HTML and get them writing HTML pages after course intro. Save How the Web Works lecture for later.
- During course intro, stress that you don't require any pre-existing knowledge of web dev, but if you've never written an HTML page before, you need to read what assign, and probably do some more reading on your own.

First Lab:
- If the quarter starts mid-week again, just teach a normal class on that first Friday, and make it about HTML syntax and semantics, not the VCS/FTP tools.
- If you do the lab, give them a pre-done page and image to manage in the tools. Have them make minor edits to the page, but don't have them to write it from scratch. Also consider just dispensing with FileZilla and teach them how to deploy with ssh and git clone/pull. Much simpler.

Basic HTML Lecture:
- Instead of a self-directed in-class challenge on choosing the right semantics tags, consider doing it interactively with them, and make them decide as a group which tags should be used for which kinds of constructs.
- Also make sure you cover block vs inline distinction, even though that can be changed in CSS, as validators will complain about misuse.
